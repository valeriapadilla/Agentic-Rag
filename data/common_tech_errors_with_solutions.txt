Common IT Support Issues and Solutions:

1. Network connectivity problems (internet unreachable, DNS failures)
   Solution: Check physical connections, reboot the router, use `ipconfig /flushdns`, verify DNS settings.

2. Intermittent Wi-Fi disconnections
   Solution: Update wireless drivers, change Wi-Fi channel on the router, move closer to the access point.

3. Slow internet speeds or high latency
   Solution: Test speed with a diagnostic tool, check for background downloads, restart network devices.

4. VPN connection failures or authentication errors
   Solution: Verify credentials, check VPN server status, update VPN client, ensure firewall allows VPN ports.

5. Password resets and account lockouts
   Solution: Use self-service password reset tool or contact admin, check account lockout policies.

6. Email issues (cannot send/receive, mailbox full)
   Solution: Clear mailbox storage, check SMTP/IMAP settings, verify server status, restart email client.

7. Software crashes or application freezing
   Solution: Update/reinstall the application, check for compatibility, review error logs, install patches.

8. Installation errors and update failures
   Solution: Run installer as administrator, clear temp files, free disk space, check for pending reboots.

9. Printer malfunctions (paper jams, offline status)
   Solution: Clear jams, reboot printer, reinstall printer drivers, check network/printer sharing settings.

10. Slow computer performance (high CPU/memory usage)
    Solution: Close unnecessary applications, run antivirus scan, upgrade RAM or SSD, update system.

11. System crashes or blue screens of death (BSOD)
    Solution: Check hardware for faults (RAM, disk), update drivers, boot in safe mode and review crash codes.

12. Hardware failures (hard drive errors, motherboard issues)
    Solution: Run diagnostics (chkdsk, SMART), backup data, replace faulty components.

13. Peripheral device issues (mouse/keyboard not detected)
    Solution: Reconnect USB ports, update drivers, test on another port or device.

14. Application login errors and authentication failures
    Solution: Verify user credentials, reset passwords, check authentication server connectivity.

15. Missing or corrupt files/DLL errors
    Solution: Run `sfc /scannow`, reinstall the affected application, restore from backup.

16. File permission and access denied errors
    Solution: Adjust file/folder permissions, run as administrator, check group membership.

17. Backup or restore failures
    Solution: Check backup paths, ensure sufficient storage, verify credentials and service status.

18. Security alerts (virus/malware detections)
    Solution: Quarantine/remove threats, update antivirus definitions, perform full system scan.

19. Software license activation errors
    Solution: Verify license key, check internet activation requirements, contact vendor support.

20. Power and battery issues (device not charging)
    Solution: Check power adapter, test battery health, update power management drivers.
